                <p>My family moved from Colorado to Florida when I was two years old, and I have lived in Florida for the last 22 years, most of which has been spent in Orlando.
                        I went to college at the University of Florida where I received both my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Accounting.
                       I initially worked full time as a tax analyst at Citibank in Tampa, but I have recently begun work as an auditor at Deloitte
                       here in Orlando. </p>
         
                    
         
                <p>Two of my main hobbies are video games and working out. I have played video games often since I was in middle school,
                        starting with Halo 2, and have also built several PCs for both myself and my friends over the years. I also enjoy
                        weightlifting and love seeing the progress I can make over time.</p>
                
     
                 <p>I hope to learn as much as I can about software development in these next 24 weeks, as I hope to move
                        into that field full time!</p>
